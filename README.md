Speed up your Mac's login time by delaying the launch of OS X login items. Makes fine-tuned, stacked delays possible.

## Initial Open Source notes

This code is old, and it was thrown together rather sloppily (the first version was whipped up in a single day).

I never thought I'd be open sourcing it, and I never expected it to be as popular as it got ([LifeHacker!](http://lifehacker.com/delayedlauncher-delays-the-startup-time-of-login-items-506597597)).

I've decided to open source it because I don't have the time to maintain it.

To whomever picks it up, I have the following suggestions:

- Clean up my ugly & rushed code.
- Fix ['Hide' not working on newer systems](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2011/01/delayedlauncher-2-2/#comment-5272).
- Use [TECommon](https://github.com/taoeffect/TECommon) instead of `Common.h`.
- Use [TERecord](https://github.com/taoeffect/TERecord) instead of `NSMutableDictionaries`.
- Switch to ARC and Objective-C 2+.
- Give it a nice website.
- Talk to me if you have any questions. I'm [easy to get in touch with](https://fixingtao.com).
